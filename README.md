# CSE 135 Examples
This is a collection of annotated code samples for CSE 135 at UCSD, a web development class taught with Java, Ruby, and AJAX. I've made an effort to demonstrate best practices along with the concepts, but sometimes correctness will take a backseat to avoid overcomplicating things. Usually I'll make a note.

## Contents
Currently included are:

* Basic AJAX via native methods
* AJAX with XML response
* AJAX with JSON response

## Usage
Clone or unzip this project into a Tomcat application and open the top-level folder in your browser. (Cloning is better because there might be updates.) Source files are commented so you can see what's going on.

## Questions, etc
This repo is maintained by Bulat Bochkariov, not the CSE 135 course staff. Please see them if you have general questions, but anything specific to this code should be directed at me. Suggestions and pull requests welcome. :)
